# 2) Goals, Needs, Values, and Dreams

### A. What you perceive in the world is directly related to your goals.
What you want illuminates the path toward where you want to go from where you are right now. Goals also illuminate obstacles in the way and things to avoid. 

### B. Create a high goal, a valuable vision, but aim low for each step on the journey.
Move forward daily, regardless of how small the move or progress feels. Progress can be an unimaginably small step, but that's way better than not moving forward. Easy, small steps you do daily become the successful habits that help achieve your goal. If you don't feel like doing a small step, then the step is not small or easy enough. Make the step small enough so you'll feel okay with doing it. Don't let huge progress be the enemy of good enough/small progress daily that will compound over time and turn into massive accomplishments.

### C. Your goals generally align with your beliefs and values.
People organize into groups/religions/movements based on beliefs/values, what do you want? Now, in a month, in a year, in 5 years? Why do you want that? You need an aim that illuminates your path. What do you want to avoid? It reveals what to avoid and further motivate you toward your aim, you can't get what you want if you don't specify it or ask for it, it should include problem-solving skills because it builds independence and adaptability to take on the world no matter what it throws at you, independence builds your confidence and ability to control your destiny and overcome danger, you have to take care of your goals and needs just like you do for other people or you will become bitter and resentful because you don't get what you want.

### D. The first draft of anything is shit.
Small steps toward a goal feel insignificant, but you can climb mountains one small step at a time, you can build tall skyscrapers one piece at a time, take those small steps knowing individually they feel insignificant and pathetic, but over time they grow and create mind-boggling achievements, set the smallest and easiest goals possible to get you started, build positive momentum and daily progress to propel you on the journey, small course corrections have wildly different destinations over time, it's tiny improvements daily that destroy massive improvements over a short period because you overwork, lose motivation, and can't keep up the high demands, but you can keep up small daily demands that compound and grow into huge accomplishments, you just have to be patient and trust that your progress is real.

### E. Develop a network of friends, family, and coworkers that can help accelerate your progress towards your goals.
Two minds are better than one, a thousand minds a way better than one, especially if you find many experts in their fields to help you.

### F. Find a career that's valuable to you, valuable to society, and matches your personality and talents.
If talents are lacking that's okay, just work on improving them.

### G. Hope is a vision of the future that's worth suffering for in the now.
You're willing to sacrifice pleasure/forgo gratification now for big payoffs in the future, like schooling or sports practice. If you don't have hope for the future, your focus switches to instant gratification because why not, you may not have a future so have all the fun, excitement, and danger all right now.

### H. Face your true self.
Your weaknesses and strengths, so you can fix the mistakes, do the proper things, and focus on your strengths.

### I. Sometimes you are suffering because of the values and goals you chose.
If that's the case, you need to fully reexamine what you want and what you value, and sacrifice/let go of the ones that are causing you to suffer, sometimes that will help sort out that value, but most importantly, you realign with a vision and values that help you, not hurt you.
