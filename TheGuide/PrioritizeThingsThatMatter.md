4) Prioritize things that matter
a. Some things are much more important than other things, 80/20 Principle/Power Law, find them, remember them to dramatically improve performance, sometimes we lose perspective and focus on problems that don't matter compared to other problems  
b. Some little things add up quickly and become very important things, "it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folks that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness and love." -Gandalf  
e. Data is toxic to memory, too many choices is toxic to decision making, get lots of and a variety of info but filter it down to the most important and impactful pieces to improve memory retention   
c. you could die at any time, today is special, cut things, jobs, options, ideas, people, etc. that are not beneficial to you, hurting you,   
d. The principle goal of the scientific method is to disprove a hypothesis, not to support it, the more attacks an idea withstands, the more important and factual it is   
g. Never memorize something you can look up - Einstein  
h. Sometimes it's important to quit, in fact, you'd be wasting time, aka opportunity cost, if you kept doing something you should quit, you could be doing something much more meaningful and rewarding instead, you just spent a little time proving it wasn't beneficial to you, don't let it keep hurting you because of sunk cost fallacy,  
I. Some small things every day add up to very important huge things over time, oxytocin helps inhibit addiction
