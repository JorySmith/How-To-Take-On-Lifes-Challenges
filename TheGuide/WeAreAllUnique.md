# 1) We're All Unique

### A. We all have unique lives, circumstances, perspectives, preferences, tragedies, and triumphs, therefore, this guide is unique to me. 
What works for me may not work for you, so if you finish this guide to taking on life's challenges, please consider creating your own guide. Does one size fit all? Not usually, so it's important for you to decide what goes in your guide.  

Some of us are granted great abilities. Some of us are cursed with terrible disabilities. Regardless, we all must take responsibility for our lives and figure out what works for us. Consider sharing your guide. We could collaborate and try to help people achieve their dreams and alleviate their suffering.  

### B. We also overlap a lot and have plenty of common ground, pains, tragedies, beliefs, values, and dreams.

### C. We all have something society needs, so find your niche that matches your personality and temperament, and master it.

### D. Everyone can teach you something valuable.
You only need to be interested in people and talk to them. You never know what someone is going through or has gone through, but they may let you know if you take the time to ask.

### E. Nature has selected successful features through evolution over billions of years that you possess.
Organisms do what has been successful and rewarded for that organism. Selected features are tailored to specific environments and they are beneficial for a reason you may not realize yet. So be careful dismissing your personality traits as boring, trivial, good, or bad. The bottom line is they have been successful for millennia.
