# 3) Write Down and Talk About Your Ideas

### A. Ideas are poorly processed and selected if kept in your head.
It's incredible the dumb stuff we believe until the second we talk about it or write it down. Write down, talk about, or teach your ideas so they can be processed, analyzed, filtered, and prioritized. The objective is to sharpen ideas by filtering out the bad ones, finding the good ones, and sharpening them until they're razor-sharp. 

### B. A small bad unknown feels much worse than a very bad known. An ignored threat feels much worse than an identified threat. Not processing ideas, emotions, and experiences through writing or talking significantly contributes to anxiety, worry, and depression. The amygdala in our brain is saying these issues are important and it wants us to process and address them. We can't do that in our head very well at all, so we must use the pen and our voice. After which, we feel safer and calmer, as though we feel less of a threat from these processed issues, and that's literally true. The amygdala will calm your emotions once important issues and threats are respected, observed, understood, and mitigated in some way. Writing things down or talking about them calms you down and gives you control over your life. It helps you get your bearings on where you are at, the lay of the land, the landscape of problems and solutions, it adds certainty and removes uncertainty
