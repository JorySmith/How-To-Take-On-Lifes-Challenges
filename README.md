# How to Take On Life's Challenges
"Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late."  
-Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

This is a guide for rising to life's challenges, achieving dreams, and alleviating pain and suffering.

Life is filled with suffering and joy but it can always be made worse by your own stupidity or someone else's malevolence.

We experience many challenges and tragedies in life. Some we've already endured and some we are about to endure. What we can do is prepare and improve ourselves for the hidden ones waiting for us around the corner. 

You rise to your level of preparation. Failing to prepare is preparing to fail. 

You may not be good at something right now, but you can get better. Now is a great time to start.

# Princple 1 - We're All Unique (Excerpt)
A. We all have unique lives, circumstances, perspectives, preferences, tragedies, and triumphs, therefore, this guide is unique to me. What works for me may not work for you, so if you finish this guide to taking on life's challenges, delete it and create your own guide. One size rarely fits all, so you are responsible for deciding what goes in your guide. Some of us are granted great abilities. Some of us are cursed with terrible disabilities. Regardless, we all must take responsibility for our lives and figure out what works for us. Consider sharing your guide. We could collaborate and try to help people achieve their dreams and alleviate their suffering.
