# How to Take On Life's Challenges
"Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late."  
-Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

This is a guide for rising to life's challenges, achieving dreams, and alleviating pain and suffering.

Life is filled with suffering and joy but it can always be made worse by your own stupidity or someone else's malevolence.

We experience many challenges and tragedies in life. Some we've already endured and some we are about to endure. What we can do is prepare and improve ourselves for the hidden ones waiting for us around the corner. 

You rise to your level of preparation. Failing to prepare is preparing to fail. 

You may not be good at something right now, but you can get better. Now is a great time to start.

### A. We all have unique lives, circumstances, perspectives, preferences, tragedies, and triumphs, therefore, this guide is unique to me.
