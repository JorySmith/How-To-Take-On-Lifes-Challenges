# How to Take On Life's Challenges
"Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late."  
-Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

This is a living guide (in constant draft) for rising to life's challenges, achieving dreams, and alleviating pain and suffering.

Life is filled with joy and suffering but it can always be made worse by our own stupidity or someone else's malevolence. Even people that seem to be the happiest online or in person suffer. In fact, you likely won't have to dig very deep at all before you find something truly tragic in their lives. Some suffering we've already endured and some we are about to endure. What we can do is prepare and improve ourselves now for the approaching challenges just around the corner. 

We rise to our level of preparation. Failing to prepare is preparing to fail. We may not be good at something right now, but we can always get a little better each day and a little closer to who we want to be.  

Now is a great time to start.

## 1) We're All Unique (Excerpt)

### A. We all have unique lives, circumstances, perspectives, preferences, tragedies, and triumphs, therefore, this guide is unique to me. 
What works for me may not work for you, so if you finish this guide to taking on life's challenges, please consider creating your own guide. Does one size fit all? Not usually, so it's important for you to decide what goes in your guide.  

Some of us are granted great abilities. Some of us are cursed with terrible disabilities. Regardless, we all must take responsibility for our lives and figure out what works for us. Consider sharing your guide. We could collaborate and try to help people achieve their dreams and alleviate their suffering.
